title: My First Blog Post

I have decided that my first blog post will be on the CRAP Method. 
The concept of CRAP for has helped me for over 8 years and probably years to come. It has allowed all of my interface and data visualization designs appear seamless and easy to understand for clients, colleagues, and even myself!


### So what is CRAP you say?

CRAP stands for:
* Contrast
* Repetition
* Alignment
* Proximity

This design method has been used by graphic designers for decades, and is now proving itself to be applicable to modern online interface design, as well as data visualization. By going through the four concepts related to your design or visualization, you will be able to pinpoint areas of improvement in your design and allow for a pleasing aesthetic that doesn't appear chunky or illogical. 
Data viz needs to be highlighting all of the important things the right way, if it's not pleasing to look at, chances are no one will pay attention!
